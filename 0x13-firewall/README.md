# Description

Well configuring a firewall in linux is not that bad so to say. 
Especially with ufw (Uncomplicated firewall).

`ufw status` checks if firewall status.
`ufw default deny incoming` - disables any incoming traffic. (entering the server)
`ufw default allow outgoing` - allow any outgoing traffic.(leaving the server)
