## Postmoterm

This Postmoterm is an analysis for a service that experienced an outage.
After the outage what was done, how was it resolved and how long did it take.
So more like a report on why the service failed.

This is necessary especially for large teams in order to figure out.
The weakpoints in the system & improve on them.
